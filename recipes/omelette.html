        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A ham and cheese omelette is a savory dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them in a pan until set. The omelette is typically filled with diced or sliced ham and melted cheese, which is usually cheddar, Swiss, or American, though any type of cheese can be used. It’s often seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes herbs, making it a comforting and satisfying breakfast or brunch option.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 slices deli ham, chopped into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and cook until browned and crispy, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs with 1 teaspoon chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture into the skillet; let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that uncooked egg runs under cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move uncooked egg. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top and fold omelette in half. Flip and cook until egg is entirely set and cheese has melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Slide onto a plate and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon chives.</li>
        </ol>
